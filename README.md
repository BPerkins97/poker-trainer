# poker-trainer

## What are we doing

1. Make it possible to play poker via REST API.
2. Build a frontend for poker.
3. Introduce agents to play against that play randomly.
4. Refine agents so that they learn over time.
5. Make the agents move visible in the frontend so users can learn from the agent.
